## Play Store App Review Analysis

Over the years, Google Play Store has evolved into a one-stop platform for downloading apps from different categories. It is the central hub for millions of apps for your smartphone. In this project, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Play Store App by comparing over ten thousand apps and reviews across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

## Problem Statement

Analyzing App Performance and User Sentiment in the Google Play Store

Objective: The objective of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on two datasets related to the Google Play Store. The analysis aims to gain insights into app performance, user sentiment, and the relationship between app characteristics and user reviews.

---

## Approach

Tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Perform necessary data cleaning steps, handle missing values, and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.
2. **App Performance Analysis:** Explore the dataset to understand app performance metrics such as ratings, reviews, installs, and pricing. Identify trends, popular categories, and factors that contribute to app success.
3. **User Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze the user reviews dataset to gain insights into user sentiment towards different apps. Investigate the distribution of sentiments, identify common positive and negative sentiments, and explore the relationship between sentiment and app characteristics.
4. **Correlation and Insights:** Investigate correlations between app performance metrics, user sentiment, and other relevant features. Discover meaningful patterns, relationships, or insights that can provide valuable recommendations or suggestions for app developers or stakeholders.
5. **Data Visualization:** Utilize appropriate visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) to effectively present the findings and communicate insights.
---
## Deliverables:

* Exploratory Data Analysis report summarizing the key findings, insights, and visualizations.
* Visualizations and plots to support the analysis.
